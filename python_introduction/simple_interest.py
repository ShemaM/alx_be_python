#Objective: Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.
# simple_interest.py
principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate_of_interest = 0.05  # Annual interest rate in percentage (5%)
time_in_years = 3  # Time in years

interest = principal * rate_of_interest * time_in_years

print("The simple interest is: ", interest)
